# DirectedWeightedGraph
This task is dedicated to the design and implementation of data structures and algorithms on graphs (directed and weighted)

## Algorithms:
shortestPath(int src, int dest) and shortestPathDist(int src, int dest) :
we used dijkstra algorithm
Use the algorithm to calculate the distances from each node from any other node.
After we just go back to finding the node with the best average range for each other node.

tsp:
 Computes a list of consecutive nodes which go over all the nodes in cities.
 the sum of the weights of all the consecutive (pairs) of nodes (directed) is the "cost" of the solution -

center() :
Finds the NodeData which minimizes the max distance to all the other nodes.
